# Audio Unit Templates for OS X

Easily create Audio Units in Xcode.

These templates customize Xcode's New Project dialog to create Audio
Unit projects.  At the moment, only Audio Effect and Monotimbral Synth
units are implemented.

## How to Use

Open Xcode.  Create a new project.  Select Audio Unit as the project
category, then select the type of unit.

See the [Audio Unit Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MusicAudio/Conceptual/AudioUnitProgrammingGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html) for more information.

## How to Install

Copy the `Audio Unit` folder into your
`~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates` folder.


## Compatibility

It works on my Mac running OS X 10.10 "Yosemite" and Xcode Version 6.1
(6A1052d).  It might possibly work on some other Mac or software version.
