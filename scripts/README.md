Good luck figuring these out.  I wrote these scripts two years ago,
and I don't really remember what they do.

I think templates.py looks through all the Xcode project templates it
can find and prints things about them; I used it to reverse engineer
the template format.

And print-source-hierarchy creates a plist-XML snippet that was pasted
into the .plist files at some point.
